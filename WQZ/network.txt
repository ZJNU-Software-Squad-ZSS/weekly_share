1. Internet is largest engineered system ever created by mainkind
2. Hundereds of millions of connected computers, communication link, switches with of billions of users connect with
    Laptops, smartphones, tablet and many new things such refrigerator, light-bulb, AC and TV all connected to internet.
3. What is the Internet?  "Nuts and bolt view"
     Internet is a computer network that interconnects billions of computing devices throughout the world.
    These devices are divided into
	a. Traditional Devices: Desktop PC, Linux WorkStation and server(stores and transmit information in the form
                                                                                                                             Webpages)
	b.Non-Traditional Devices or "Things": Laptops, SmartPhones, Tablets, TV, car, watches and eyeGlasses
					Trafic Control System.
4.  These devices technically called as "Host"  or "End Systems".
5. End Systems are connected together by network of communication Links such 
	There are various types of communication Links such as 
		a. Coaxial cable , Optical Fiber, Radio Spectrum .
6. Different Communication Link can Transmit data at different rates measured in bits/second
7.When One end system has data to send to another end system, The Sending end segments the data in smaller packets and 
	adds header to it. These are sent through the network to the destination end system where they are reassembled into
	the original  data.
8. Packet Switches:  takes up the data from its incomming commuication link and forwards it to outgoing communication link.
   packet switches comes in many flavour but the two most popular is
	a. Router
	b. Link-Layer Switches
9. task of these swicthes is to forward the data to there respective destination
10. Example: Factory wants to move cargo to warehouse located at thousands of kilometers away.
		a. At factory the cargo is segmented and loaded into a fleet of trucks.
		b. Trucks travels independently through the network of highways , roads and intersections
			to the destination warehouse.
		c. At the destination cargo is unloaded and grouped with other cargo arriving from same shipment.
11. 	a. Packets are analogous to trucks
	b. Communication links are analogous to highway, roads 
	c. packet switches are analogous to intersections.
	d. end systems are analogous to buildings.

12. End System access the internet through Internet Service Provider(ISP).
	a. ISP is a network of packet switches and communication link.
	b. There are Many different types of ISP Such as
		1. Residential ISP: Local Cable, Telephone Companies
		2. Corporate ISP, University ISP.
		3. ISP that provides wifi access in airports, hotels coffee shops 
		4. Cellular data ISP: Providing mobile access to our smartphones and other devices.
13. These ISP are interconnected with each other to connect the end system with each other.
14. Protocol:   (Language or standards of communication).
	      "A set of rules that must be followed during conversation"
15. End System, packet Switches and other parts of internet runs  using some standards that is Protocol
16. This Protocol Controls the sending and receiving of information within the Internet.
17. The Transmission Control Protocol [TCP] and Internet Protocol[IP] are two important protocols in the internet.
18. Protocols must be followed by everyone so a standard has to be created.so everyone can be in the same picture.
19. Internet Standard are developed by Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF).
20. The IETF standard documents are called requests for comments(RFCs).

What's the Internet : A Service View?

1. Another Angle: "Internet is an Infrastructure that provide services to applications" 
2. The Applications that resides on end systems are:
		a. e-mail
		b. web-surfing
		c. SmartPhones and Tablet Application such as;
			1. Internet messaging
			2. GPS
			3. Social Networks
			4. Video Conferencing
			5. Multi-Person Games
			6. Banking Applications
3. These applications are "distributed applications". What is Distributed Application? program running on various end system
								and interacting with each other.
4. Suppose you want to be famous/rich by creating distributed game application where multiple player can play game over
	the internet.
5. For smooth exchange of data between multiple player, this distributed application must request Internet Insfrastructure
	to send and receive data.
6. Every End system attached to internet provides "Socket Interface", This Socket Interface is reponsible for setting up rules that
	must be followed by distributed application during exchange of data.
7. Alice wants to send gift to bob, Alice must use the Postal Service.
8. Alice must follow the rules setup by "postal service interface" i.e. she must write proper address, name pincode.

****************************************************************************************************
What is a Protocol?
1. Human Protocol: You want to ask someone time of the day, you start your conversation with
		"Hi"  -------------------If response is "Hi" you can go on asking time
				
				if response is "Don't bother me"  this shows inability to communicate.
2. In Human protocol: specific message send, and specific action we take in response to the received reply message plays
			a key role in Human Protocol
3. Network protocol: Machines sends, recieve and take actions in response to reply message.
4. All communication over the internet is governed by protocol .
5. example of  TCP Connection and requesting for web page.

"A protocol defined the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities" as well as 
	action taken.
******************************************************************************************************
Network Edge

1. end systems are called end system because they sit at the edge of the internet.
2. end systems are also called as hosts because they host application programs such as web browser and many other app.
3. Let's Discuss about Internet of Things (IoT).
4. Hosts= EndSystems
5. Hosts are further divided into Clients and Servers.
6. Clients are Desktop PC, SmartPhones
7. Servers are more powerful machines and resides in large data center.
8. Google has 50-100 data centers, including about 15 large data center each with more 100,000 servers.
****************************************************************************************************

Access Networks
" The Network that physically connects an end system to the first router is termed as Acess network."

Home Access: DSL (Digital Subscriber Line)
1. The two most famous broadband residential access are digital subscriber line(DSL) and Cable.
2. When DSL is used, Customer's telephone company is its ISP.
3. Each customer's Modem uses the existing telephone line to exchange data with a 
	Digital Subscriber Line access multiplexer(DSLAM	)
4. The Analog Signals from many such houses are translated back into digital.
5. The residential telephone carries both data and telephone signals simultaneously.
6. Different frequencies are used for voice and data transmission as given below:
		1. 0-4kHz   	-> Ordinary two way telephone channel
		2. 4-50kHz 	-> Upstream Channel
		3. 50-1MHz	-> Downstream Channel
7. This division of Frequency is FDM(Frequency Division Multiplexing).
8. The DSLAM seperates the data and phone signals and sends the data into the internet.

Cable
1. Fiber-Optics connects the cable head end to neighborhood-level Junction(Building or society).
2. from Neighborhood-level junction, coaxial cable is used to reach indiviual houses .
3. Both Fiber and coaxial cable is used it is also referred as Hybrid Fiber Coax(HFC).
4. Cable Internet access require special modem called cable modems,
5. This modem is typically an external device connects to home pc through Ethernet Port.
6. CMTS (Cable Model Termination System) acts exactly line DSLAM, it converts Analog Signal to Digital Signal.
7. Cable Internet access is a Shared broadcast medium that is;
		1. packet sent by the head end travels downstream on every link to every home 
		2. For this reason the speed will vary.
8. UpComing technology that provides even higher speed is fiber to the Home (FTTH).
9. FTTH provides an optical fiber path from the CO directly to the home.

Enterprise/Home Access : Ethernet and Wifi

1. On Corporate ,University and Home, A Local Area Network (LAN) is used to connect and end System to the edge router.
2. Ethernet users use twisted-pair copper wire to connect to an Ethernet switch.(Ethernet Switch Will be Discussed later).

Wireless network----refer to ppt.
*******************************************************************************************************
Physical Media

1. Physical Media are of two types
	a. Guided Media		: Waves guided along solid medium such as 
					-Fiber Optic cable
					-Twisted-Pair copper wire
					-Coaxial Cable 
	b. Unguided Media		: Waves travel in atmosphere such as wireless LAN .

2. Example of physical Media include:
		1. Twisted-Pair Copper wire
		2. Coaxial Cable
		3. Fibre-Optic cable
		4. Radio Spectrum  : Terrestrial or Satellite
3. Life of bit starts from one end system and travels along various swicthes connected with various different kinds of 
	physical medium.

4. Labor cost for the installation is more compared to actual cost of physical link.


1. Twisted-Pair Copper Wire
	- Least expensive and most commonly used .
	- for over 100's of year used by telephone networks
	- it consists of two insulated copper wires , each about 1mm thick.
	- Data rates for LAN using twisted pair today is range from 10Mbps to 10 Gbps.

2. Coaxial Cable
	-consists of two copper conductors 
	- it's common in cable television systems.
	-it can be use as guided shared medium

3. Fiber Optics
	-it conducts pulses of light
	- each pulse representing a bit
	-it can support 10's or 100's of gigabits per second
	- due to high cost it's not deployed in a LAN and into home.

4. Radio:
	A: Terrestrial Radio Channels
		-carry signal in the electromagnetic spectrum
		-require no physical wire to be installed can penetrate walls
		-it depends on propogation environment and the distance signal has to travel
		-Terrestrial radio channel is classified into three groups
			1. very short distance: 1 or 2 meters.
			2. Local Areas:          10 to 100 meters
			3. Wide Area :           tens of Kilometers.

	B: Satellite Radio Channels
		-Communication Satellite links earth-based transmitter/receivers.
		-two types of satellites are used in Communication
			1. geostationary satellites	: remains at one spot
			2. low-earth orbiting satellites	: does not remains at one spot , it rotates just like moon

*******************************************************************************************************
The Network Core -> the mesh of packet switches and links that interconnects the Internet's end systems

Packet Switching
	-The message can be very big such as Image, video or audio
	- To send such data over network, the sources breaks it in smaller chunks know as packets
	-Packets travels through communication links and packet switches.
	-Source end system is sending a packet of L bits over a link with transmission rate of R bits/sec, then
	- the time to transmit the packet is L/R seconds.

Store and Forward Transmission
	-it means that the packet switch must receive the entire packet before it can begin to transmit the first bit.
	-Now let抯 calculate the amount of time that elapses from when the source begins
	-to send the first packet until the destination has received all three packets. As before,
	-at time L/R, the router begins to forward the first packet. But also at time L/R the
	-source will begin to send the second packet, since it has just finished sending the
	-entire first packet. Thus, at time 2L/R, the destination has received the first packet
	-and the router has received the second packet. Similarly, at time 3L/R, the destina-
	-tion has received the first two packets and the router has received the third packet.
	-Finally, at time 4L/R the destination has received all three packets!

Queuing Delay and Packet Loss
	-The packet switch has an output buffer know as output queue.
	- output buffer stores packets that the router is about send into that link.
	-if an arriving packet needs to be transmitted onto a link but finds the link busy.
	- The arriving packet must wait in the output buffer queuing delays.
	-This delay depends upon congestion in the network
	- let's take the example on ppt

Forwarding Table and Routing Protocol
	- How does router forwards packets arriving at input link?
	-Every end system has an address called IP address
	- The Source end system includes destination end system IP address in the header file.
	- Each router has a forwarding table using which it forwards the packets
	-routing protocol determines shortest path from each router to each destination.


Circuit Switching
	-The resources needed for communication between end system is reserved , packet switching not reserved.
	-Kind of private path to send and receive message over the network
	-The sender can transfer the data to the receiver at the guaranteed constant rate.
	

Multiplexing in Circuit Switched Network
	- Frequency Division Multiplexing
		-Frequency spectrum is divided 
		- The Link Dedicates a frequency band to each connection for the duration of connection
		-FM radio station also uses FDM to share frequency spectrum between 88Mhz and 108Mhz
		

	-Time Division Multiplexing
		- The entire frequency band is used by one user at the given instance of time


Packet Switching vs Circuit Switching
		- packet switching is not suitable for realtime  services such telephone, video conference
		-it offers better sharing of transmission capacity
		-it is simpler, more effecient and less costly
