Two main activities:
Database design
Applications design
Focus in this chapter on database design
To design the conceptual schema for a database application
Applications design focuses on the programs and interfaces that access the database
Generally considered part of software engineering
Entities and Attributes
Entities are specific objects or things in the mini-world that are represented in the database.
For example the EMPLOYEE John Smith, the Research DEPARTMENT, the ProductX PROJECT
Attributes are properties used to describe an entity.
For example an EMPLOYEE entity may have the attributes Name, SSN, Address, Sex, BirthDate
A specific entity will have a value for each of its attributes.
For example a specific employee entity may have Name='John Smith', SSN='123456789', Address ='731, Fondren, Houston, TX', Sex='M', BirthDate='09-JAN-55‘
Each attribute has a value set (or data type) associated with it – e.g. integer, string, subrange, enumerated type, …
In general, composite and multi-valued attributes may be nested arbitrarily to any number of levels, although this is rare.
For example, PreviousDegrees of a STUDENT is a composite multi-valued attribute denoted by {PreviousDegrees (College, Year, Degree, Field)}
Multiple PreviousDegrees values can exist
Each has four subcomponent attributes:
College, Year, Degree, Field
